        grid is a list of list of integers:
            0 represents a water zone
            1 represents a land zone
            One cell is a square with side length 1
            Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
            Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100
            len(grid) = length of grid row
            len(grid[x]) = length of grid column
